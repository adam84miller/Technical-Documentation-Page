        There are hundreds if not thousands of types of meditation, here we explore the system as used by 9 stages sangha. The purpose of this document is to help you track your progress through the first three stages as taught by this system.

<p>There is no "one size fits all" approach to meditation. Experiment with many, and find some that work for your needs and personality. The type of meditation most helpful against anxiety, for instance, is not necessarily the best one against depression or for spiritual awakening.
      </p>

      <p>
9 stages sangha takes a combined approach and works on several aspects of meditation simultaneously.The beginning is highlighted by samatha/vipassana seated meditation, a morning and evening Mindfulness protocol, and even takes into consideration hygeine as well as psycho-somatic body practices. To begin, we will highlight five aspects of meditation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Focus In ~ This is based on the original insight of the Buddha. Use this to keep track of your subjective experience in terms of visual thoughts (“Images”), mental conversations (“Talk”) and emotional-type body sensations (“Feel”).
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus Out ~ Use this to anchor yourself in the present moment by focusing on external vision (“Sight”), external hearing (“Sound”) and physical-type body sensations (“Touch”). This is based on a practice commonly given to new monks in Zen temples, allowing them to remain in a meditative state while effectively performing their daily tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on Rest ~ This technique represents a contemporary reworking of the classical absorption (jhâna) practices of early Buddhism. Use this to learn to detect and enjoy naturally occurring restful states such as physical relaxation, mental blank, emotional peace and quiet moments in your head.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on Change (or Impermanence) ~ Use this technique to focus your attention on how things change and when they arise and vanish. By noticing the very moment when things vanish, your attention is directed to the Source from which they arise. This leads to the classical experience of “Cessation” referred to by the mystics of the world as True Self, No Self, Nothingness and so forth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on Positive ~ Use this technique to actively create positive Images and Talk. These then prime the pump for pleasant emotional Feel—joy, interest, enthusiasm, love, friendliness, compassion, gratitude, forgiveness and so forth. Then use concentration power to spread that pleasant Feel over the whole body and then radiate it beyond the body out to the people and objects around.

      <p>
        Awareness of breath serves as a basis for awareness in all you do. Explore this six-step practice to make mindfulness part of your daily routine:</p>
<p>First, select a suitable place for regular meditation. It can be wherever you can sit easily with minimal disturbance: a corner of the bedroom or any other quiet spot. Place a meditation cushion, bench, or chair there for use. Arrange what is around so you are reminded of meditative purpose, so that it feels like a peaceful space. Let yourself enjoy creating this space.</p>
<p>Then, establish a regular time to practice. If you are a morning person, experiment with a sitting before breakfast. If evening fits your temperament or schedule better, try that first. Begin with sitting ten or 20 minutes at a time. Later, sit longer or more frequently. Daily meditation can become like bathing or toothbrushing. It can bring a regular cleansing and calming to the heart and mind.</p>
<p>Find a posture on the chair or cushion in which you can easily sit erect without being rigid. Let the body be firmly planted on the earth, hands resting easily, your heart soft, eyes closed gently. At first feel the body and consciously soften any obvious tension. Let go of any habitual thoughts or plans.</p>
<p>Bring attention to feel the sensations of breathing. Take a few deep breaths to sense where feeling the breath comes most easily, as coolness or tingling in the nostrils or throat, as movement of the chest, or rise and fall of the belly. Then let the breath be natural. Feel the sensations of natural breathing very carefully, relaxing into each breath as you feel it, noticing how the soft sensations of breathing come and go with the changing breath.</p>
<p>After a few breaths, the mind will likely wander. When noticing this, no matter how long or short a time, simply come back to the next breath. Before returning, mindfully acknowledge where the mind has gone with a soft word in the back of the mind, such as “thinking,” “wandering,” “hearing,” “itching.” After softly and silently naming where your attention has been, gently and directly return to feel the next breath. Later on in meditation you will be able to work mindfully with all the places the mind wanders to, but for initial training, one word of acknowledgement and a simple return to breath is best.</p>
<p>When sitting, let the breath change rhythms naturally, allowing it to be short, long, fast, slow, rough, or easy. Calm yourself by relaxing into the breath. When the breath becomes soft, let attention become gentle and careful, as soft as the breath itself.</p>

    <header>Posture</header>
    <article>
      <p>Meditation isn’t only about the mind—it’s also about the body. And believe it or not, meditation isn’t meant to be physically uncomfortable. Getting posture right is key to staying relaxed and alert instead of tense or spaced out. Without that, it’s nearly impossible to focus on the present moment.</p>

<p>Chances are that when starting, meditation will feel a little awkward or uncomfortable. That’s okay. Finding the ideal meditation posture and seating arrangement can take a while. There’s no one size fits all approach and it takes time to familiarize with the subtleties of the body. We offer basic guidelines to help get started or make some tweaks.</p>

<p>6 Posture Pointers<p>
      <p>1. Eyes gaze slightly downward, 4 to 6 feet in front or eyes closed.</p>
      <p>2. Chin slightly tucked to keep your cervical spine aligned.</p>
      <p>3. Spine follows natural curvature—upright, yet natural.</p>
<p>4. Sitting bones are centered and stable—not perched too far forward or spread too far back.<p>
<p>5. Arms parallel to the torso, palms fall naturally on the thighs.<p>
      <p>6. Knees below hips, with legs loosely crossed.</p>
<p>Cover Your Bases
If you’re planning a longer session (30+ minutes), it pays to come prepared. Here’s our list of essentials: a glass of water, shawl or blanket, warm socks, timer or clock.</p>


      <p>5 Tips for Basic Seated Meditation Posture</p>
<p>1) Seat: Keep your butt centered</p>

      <p>Don’t perch!
If your seat isn’t comfortable, the rest of the body will likely tense up, which makes meditating difficult. Keep the butt in the center of the cushion or chair—if you’re too far forward the spine will arch to compensate; if too far back the spine will curve forward.</p>

<p>When beginning to sit down, rock back and forth on the sitting bones to loosen up and find solid ground. From there, posture will more easily fall into place.</p>

<p>2: Spine: Stay straight and relaxed
Relax your back!
There are two main ways the spine gets out of whack during meditation: arching or slouching. When you have more than a natural arch, things stiffen and strain, and the mind is more likely to get frantic. On the flipside, it’s hard to feel present and alert when slouched, your hands are sliding off your knees, and your chin is down. To align your spine, drape the body forward, then slowly straighten up, feeling each vertebra stack as you go.</p>

<p>3) Legs: Find the right height
If the knees are above the thighs, the hips, back, and neck will strain. For the long-legged among us, this could mean finding a higher cushion.</p>

<p>4) Knees: Try Sitting in a chair
There are many reasons to meditate in a chair: it can be easier on the knees for those with joint pain; it’s convenient when traveling; most have access to a chair even if they don’t have room for a cushion. If using a chair, resist the urge to rely too much on the chair’s back, unless you really need to. Doing so can cause your spine to go soft, making your breathing less open and inviting distraction and discomfort. Be sure to keep your feet flat on the floor. This may mean placing something under the feet if the chair is too high off the ground.</p>

<p>5: Stamina: Explore resting pose
It’s OK to take a break from your meditation posture, especially during longer sessions. Try the resting pose, bringing the knees to the chest, curving the spine forward.</p>

<p>Check Out Different Seating Options
meditation cushions
Meditation benches allow you to sit in a relaxed kneeling position while keeping posture aligned.
Rectangular cushions, or gomdens, are good for sitting cross-legged, and come in various heights and degrees of firmness.
Round cushions are used for cross-legged sitting or, placed on their side, between the legs, for a kneeling posture.</p>

    <header>Object of Attention</header>
    <p>
     Now choose a meditation object. That is, something to meditate on. The meditation object can be the breath, the rising and falling of the abdomen, a word, a physical object you will look at. It could be a mental picture that held in the mind while the eyes are closed.</p>

<p>Your object could be a specific center in the body. For example, the point half an inch above where the eyebrows meet is a common place. Another place is called the heart center. Think of a point inside the spine directly back of the heart. As concentration moves in the area of your forehead or heart center, it becomes quite specific and unified. You will soon be able to precisely focus on a chosen center. Try both centers and note which one is most comfortable, as well as easiest to focus upon. Then again, you may not choose to make either center your meditation object.</p>

<p>At first, you may wish to try various meditation objects. But remember never to force focus and remember that the object selected must be pleasing to the mind. The meditation object needs to be relatively easy to think about; and you should be able to direct your feelings toward the meditation object, naturally and pleasantly.</p>

<p>Words used as your meditation object could be Om.

  <section class="main-section" id="intention">
    <header>Intention</header>
    <article>
      <p>
      A meditation intention is like a road map of where you want to go with meditation. It's an outline to what you want your meditation to do, include and achieve.</p>

<p>An intention will also help your meditation as a way to manifest goals and bring them to fruition. It acts as the driving force behind meditation so that it can actually facilitate positive change.</p>

<p>If you are able to focus the mind on a specific intention during meditation you are bringing it to the forefront of the heart, the mind and the spirit and helping to bring that intention to reality.</p>

<p>Intentions are not mantras. While the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they are actually quite different.</p>

<p>An intention is more about how you want to feel during practice. A mantra, on the other hand, is a sound or phrase repeated in meditation. Intentions are more complex and are more than just a single word or phrase.</p>
<p>Example of Intention Meditation
If you have never set an intention for meditation before—there is no better time to start. Chances are, if you have been meditating without an intention before this—if you start adding intentions now, you will find your sessions are more focused and you may find that you are getting more out of them.</p>

<p>Here are a few sample meditation intentions that you can set in order to get you started in the right direction. Of course, you can tweak these meditation intentions as-needed to fit your life and your goals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I intend to naturally manifest happiness in my life.</li>
  <li>I intend to follow the breath.</li>
  <li>I intend to let negativity roll off my back.</li>
  <li>I intend to allow myself to be vulnerable.</li>
  <li>I intend to forgive those who have hurt me.</li>
  <li>I intend to be open to success.</li>
  <li>I intend to make time for myself every day.</li>
  <li>I intend to embrace change.</li>
  <li>I intend to find balance in my life.</li>
  <li>I intend to make healthier decisions for myself.</li>
  <li>I intend to love fully and unconditionally.</li>
  <li>I intend to do something for others.</li></ul>
<p>These don’t have to be your intentions, but they are great examples of intentions that you can use during your meditation.</p>

<p>Some are good at setting intentions ahead of time, while others simply wait until they are about ready to meditate in order to set intentions. Sometimes sitting comfortably, taking a deep breath in and allowing the intention to come can be a great first start. seeing what comes in the moment and what you feel as though you really need to focus on at that time.</p>

<p>When choosing an intention, just choose one, and write it out. Let that plant the seed for the meditation ahead of and keep it in the mind as you meditate. This is the best way to see results from your efforts.</p>

<p>The intention set for meditation is extremely important as it will dictate exactly how your meditation goes. When it comes to deciding what intention to put forth, a great place to start is by asking a few questions. This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What matters most to me?</li>
  <li>What things about myself make me proud?</li>
  <li>What am I looking to build or nurture in order to make my life better?</li>
  <li>How do I feel when I am my happiest?</li>
  <li>What am I looking to let go of?</li>
<li>Who do I want to forgive?</li>
  <li>What am I most grateful for in my life?</li></ul>
<p>These questions can help put intentions into perspective and decide upon which intention will work best for and what you are looking to achieve.</p>

<p>One of the first and most important things to remember when setting an intention is you actually have to believe in the intention set. If you force an intention or set one that doesn’t really matter then you won’t find the same success.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a wrong intention—as long as it is pushing you, positively in a direction desired your life—it is the right type of intention.</p>

<p>Start with the goal of finding an intention that will actually motivate and one that you believe in and are passionate about. From there, use these tips to come up with a powerful intention to guide your meditation.</p>

<p>Make sure to set a positive intention or put a positive spin on it. Don’t let negativity creep into the intentions set.</p>
 
<p>When it comes to setting intentions for meditation, try to think in short-term segments. It can still be part of bigger goals for life, but intentions need to be short, powerful statements you can actually see come to fruition. Before setting your intention stop and think about what you actually need in that moment.</p>
 
<p>Set short-term intentions that are part of your larger goals, so when making intentions, think of them as stepping stones towards what you want out of life. Intentions should be able to grow and change with you.</p>
 
<p>Goals are going to drive the intentions set, but remember there is a difference between intentions and goals. When setting the intention, there is no required result, it is about making a positive change that can ultimately benefit and help reach the goals set.
Setting an intention for meditation will create a roadmap for meditation and help it be more successful and more productive. Chances are, with the right intentions guiding meditations, you will start to get even more out of your practice and even more out of life.</p>

<p>A lot of intention setting is about the short-term and about what's needed currently at a certain moment in life—but they can still be part of a bigger goal. If you want to see how intentions are really working and how they are changing you for the better—keep a meditation journal.</p>

<p>If you write about what your intentions are over time and see how they change, you can see how you are growing through meditation. You may notice something you felt needed to be an intention months ago may suddenly not seem important any longer when you are meditating regularly.</p>

<p>You can use intentions to not only track growth but to stay focused in your own journey of how these intentions are shaping life and getting you closer to the things that you want to achieve.

    <header>Monkey Mind</header>
    <article>
      <p>
  We all recognize monkey mind—that wild mind going in more than one direction at a time, swinging from one branch of thought to the next. It wants the next banana, the next big thing, the next small thing. It wants to keep moving. Monkey mind likes texting, social media, and gambling. It’s the mind that likes to be mindless.</p>

<p>With our modern culture of distraction, you might think we invented the idea of speedy monkey mind. However, the Mahayana teachings in both China and Japan have talked about monkey mind for more than 1,500 years. In the ancient description of the cycle of karmic cause and effect, the nidanas, consciousness is symbolized by a monkey inside a house whose windows represent the senses.</p>

<p>Meditation is a vehicle to tame monkey mind. By sitting simply, being present, following our breath, and labeling our thoughts, we entice the monkey to come down from the trees and rest. It takes repeated effort, but eventually monkey mind calms down.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, when monkey mind is tamed, focused, and quiet, it has great energy and power. We might discover the monkey is actually a gorilla—much more potent and expansive than we imagined. It might be buddhamind, in fact.

  <section class="main-section" id="mind_wandering">
    <header>Mind Wandering</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        We’ve all been there. You’re slouched in a meeting or a classroom, supposedly paying attention, but your mind has long since wandered off, churning out lists of all the things you need to do—or that you could be doing if only you weren’t stuck here…</p>

<p>Suddenly you realize everyone is looking your way expectantly, waiting for an answer. But you’re staring blankly, grasping at straws to make a semi-coherent response. The curse of the wandering mind!</p>


<p>But don’t worry—you’re not alone. In fact, a recent study by Matthew Killingsworth and Daniel Gilbert sampled over 2,000 adults during their day-to-day activities and found that 47 percent of the time, their minds were not focused on what they were currently doing. Even more striking, when people’s minds were wandering, they reported being less happy.</p>

<p>This suggests it might be good to find ways to reduce these mental distractions and improve our ability to focus. Ironically, mind-wandering itself can help strengthen our ability to focus, if leveraged properly. This can be achieved using an age-old skill: meditation. Indeed, a new wave of research reveals what happens in our brains when our minds wander—and sheds light on the host of cognitive and emotional benefits that come with increased focus.</p>

<p>What happens in the wandering mind?<p>

<p>For something that happens so often, what do we really know about this process of mind-wandering?</p>

<p>For thousands of years, contemplative practices such as meditation have provided a means to look inward and investigate our mental processes. It may seem surprising, but mind-wandering is actually a central element of focused attention (FA) meditation. In this foundational style of meditation, the practitioner is instructed to keep her attention on a single object, often the physical sensations of breathing.</p>

<p>If you’re like most people, before long your attention will wander away into rumination, fantasy, analyzing, planning. At some point, you might realize that your mind is no longer focused on the breath. With this awareness, you proceed to disengage from the thought that had drawn your mind away, and steer your attention back to your breath. A few moments later, the cycle will likely repeat.</p>

<p>At first it might seem like the tendency toward mind-wandering would be a problem for the practice of FA meditation, continually derailing your attention from the “goal” of keeping your mind on the breath.</p>

<p>However, the practice is really meant to highlight this natural trajectory of the mind, and in doing so, it trains your attention systems to become more aware of the mental landscape at any given moment, and more adept at navigating it. With repeated practice, it doesn’t take so long to notice that you’ve slipped into some kind of rumination or daydream. It also becomes easier to drop your current train of thought and return your focus to the breath. Those who practice say that thoughts start to seem less “sticky”—they don’t have such a hold on you.</p>

<p>Being familiar with both subjective, first-person meditative practice and objective, third-person scientific research, I wondered what would happen if I put these two modes of investigation together. Could I get a more fine-grained picture of how this process works in the brain by leveraging the experience of these cognitive shifts during meditation?</p>

<p>I started by considering the default mode network, a set of brain areas that tend to increase in activity when we’re not actively engaged in anything else—in other words, when our minds tend to wander. Maybe it was this default mode network that kept barging in during my meditation, interfering with my ability to keep my attention focused. And maybe this network was what I was learning to “tune down” by practicing over and over. I wondered if I could test this scientifically.</p>

<p>Supported with the help of colleagues at Emory University, I started to test which brain areas were related to meditation. We asked meditators to focus on their breath while we scanned their brains: whenever they realized their minds had been wandering, they’d press a button. Then they would return their focus to the breath as usual, and the practice would continue. As they did so, we collected MRI data showing which brain regions were active before, during, or after the button press that corresponded to various mental states.</p>

<p>The study, published in the journal NeuroImage, found that, indeed, during periods of mind-wandering, regions of the brain’s default mode network were activated. Then when participants became aware of this mind-wandering, brain regions related to the detection of salient or relevant events came online. After that, areas of the executive brain network took over, re-directing and maintaining attention on the chosen object. And all of this occurred within 12 seconds around those button presses.</p>

<p>Looking at activity in these brain networks this way suggests that when you catch your mind wandering, you are going through a process of recognizing, and shifting out of, default mode processing by engaging numerous attention networks. Understanding the way the brain alternates between focused and distracted states has implications for a wide variety of everyday tasks. For example, when your mind wandered off in that meeting, it might help to know you’re slipping into default mode—and you can deliberately bring yourself back to the moment. That’s an ability that can improve with training.</p>

<p>What are other practical implications of this knowledge? Recent behavioral research shows that practicing meditation trains various aspects of attention. Studies show that meditation training not only improves working memory and fluid intelligence, but even standardized test scores. </p>

<p>It’s not surprising—this kind of repeated mental exercise is like going to the gym, only you’re building your brain instead of your muscles. And mind-wandering is like the weight you add to the barbell—you need some “resistance” to the capacity you’re trying to build. Without mind-wandering to derail your attempts to remain focused, how could you train the skills of watching your mind and controlling your attention?</p>


<p>In our study, we also wanted to look at the effects of lifetime meditation experience on brain activity. In agreement with a growing number of studies, we found that experience mattered—those who were more experienced meditators had different levels of brain activity in the relevant networks. This suggests that their brains may have changed due to repeated practice, a process called neuroplasticity.</p>

<p>One brain area stood out in this analysis: the medial prefrontal cortex, a part of the default mode network that is particularly related to self-focused thoughts, which make up a good portion of mind-wandering content. It turns out that experienced meditators deactivated this region more quickly after identifying mind-wandering than people who hadn’t meditated as much—suggesting they might be better at releasing distracting thoughts, like a re-hash of a personal To Do list or some slight they suffered at work yesterday.</p>

<p>In a follow-up study, we found that these same participants had greater coherence between activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and brain areas that allow you to disengage attention. This means that the brain regions for attentional disengagement have greater access to the brain regions underlying the distraction, possibly making it easier to disengage. Other findings support this idea—more experienced meditators have increased connectivity between default mode and attention brain regions, and less default mode activity while meditating.</p>

<p>This might explain how it feels easier to “drop” thoughts as you become more experienced in meditation—and thus better able to focus. Thoughts become less sticky because your brain gets re-wired to be better at recognizing and disengaging from mind-wandering. And if you’ve ever struggled with rumination—re-living a negative experience over and over, or stressing (unproductively) about an upcoming event—you can appreciate how being able to let go of your thoughts could be a huge benefit.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Killingsworth and Gilbert study I mentioned earlier found that when people’s minds were wandering, they tended to be less happy, presumably because our thoughts often tend towards negative rumination or stress. That’s why mindfulness meditation has become an increasingly important treatment of mental health difficulties like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and even sexual dysfunction.</p>

<p>Reading all this might make you think that we’d be better off if we could live our lives in a constant state of laser-like, present moment focus. But a wandering mind isn’t all bad. Not only can we leverage it to build focus using FA meditation, but the capacity to project our mental stream out of the present and imagine scenarios that aren’t actually happening is hugely evolutionarily valuable, which may explain why it’s so prominent in our mental lives. These processes allow for creativity, planning, imagination, memory—capacities that are central not only to our survival, but also to the very essence of being human.</p>

<p>The key, I believe, is learning to become aware of these mental tendencies and to use them purposefully, rather than letting them take over. Meditation can help with that.

  <section class="main-section" id="forgetting">
    <header>Forgetting</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        After we have get ourselves seated, the second hindrance then comes up and is our next biggest problem. This is when we forget the object of meditation. Let us say we are trying to use the breath as our object of meditation. You take two breaths and then your mind is off in never- never land. Or you visualize the image of the Buddha and then, “goodbye”—it disappears or changes. The mind just totally goes off the object. It does not have the ability to stay on the object because there is no stability in the mind. The mind just constantly forgets it.</p>

<p>This kind of forgetting is a specific mental factor and it has a specific meaning here. It is not the same as forgetting where I put my keys. Rather it is forgetting in the context of calm abiding. What happens is, our mind forgets the object of meditation and instead is distracted towards something else.</p>

<p>The antidote to forgetting the object of meditation—or sometimes translated as forgetting the instruction—is mindfulness.</p>

<p>Antidote: Mindfulness and its three qualities
Mindfulness is another mental factor and here it has a very specific meaning. It has three qualities.</p>

<p>Familiarity ~
Mindfulness is familiar with the object of meditation. Whatever our object of meditation, whether it is loving kindness, or the breath, or the image of the Buddha, or the ugly aspects of phenomena, or whatever it is, our mind is familiar with it. In other words, we cannot have mindfulness or the memory of an object if the mind is unfamiliar with that object.</p>

<p>Holding onto the object ~
The second quality is that mindfulness holds onto the object so that the object is not forgotten. So the mode of apprehension of the object is something that is continuous. The mind does not forget the different aspects and does not forget what it is doing.</p>

<p>Prevents distraction ~
The third quality is that mindfulness prevents distraction. By being familiar with the object of meditation and having a continuous memory of the object, it functions in such a way to prevent distractions so that other thoughts do not intervene.</p>

<p>Illustrations of mindfulness ~
Sometimes you will see a little drawing about the different stages to develop calm abiding. Mindfulness is symbolized by having a rope around an elephant and tying it down. It is depicted that way because that is the first big thing that we have to do: learning to tie the mind to the object of meditation.</p>

<p>Another illustration ~ losing the object of meditation is like a child running wildly around and running out the door. Your kid is running out the door and runs here, there and everywhere. Mindfulness is bringing that child back into the room and saying, “Look here.”</p>

<p>With practice, the thoughts will settle
As we keep practicing mindfulness and keep bringing the mind back to the object of meditation, after a while the thoughts get tired of running around all the time. I am not saying that this is necessarily going to happen in one meditation session but, as you practice, over a period of time as your memory and mindfulness gets stronger, the thoughts that instantaneously take you away from the object of your meditation are going to become less strong and they begin to take a rest.</p>

<p>Sticking with one object of meditation ~
It is important to stick with one object of meditation when we are developing calm abiding and not change objects all the time. The first of the three qualities of mindfulness is familiarity with the object. If we keep changing the object of our meditation for calm abiding, then our mindfulness does not get a chance to function.</p>

<p>Of course, if you are doing practice during the course of the day, you may choose to be mindful of many different things. Sometimes you might meditate on Chenrezig, or Tara, or the breath, or loving kindness and in all those different meditations you are mindful of each of the objects of meditation. But when you are really setting out to develop calm abiding on a specific object, you want to develop an especial familiarity with that object.</p>

<p>What we are doing a lot in our daily practice is developing familiarity with a lot of different facets. That is good and we need to do that. I am just saying that when we are actually going for developing full calm abiding, we have to stick with the same object each meditation session. This is because if one session you are focusing on the rise and fall of your abdomen and the next session you’re focusing on the breath at your nostrils and the session after that, you are focusing on the Buddha, and then next you are at Tara, and the next session you are at loving kindness, your ability to be mindful of one object to the point of developing calm abiding on it is quite limited.p

      <p>
        Our true home is not in the past. Our true home is not in the future. Our true home is in the here and the now. Life is available only in the here and the now, and it is our true home.</p>

<p>Mindfulness is the energy that helps us recognize the conditions of happiness that are already present in our lives. You don’t have to wait ten years to experience this happiness. It is present in every moment of your daily life. There are those of us who are alive but don’t know it. But when you breathe in, and you are aware of your in-breath, you touch the miracle of being alive. That is why mindfulness is a source of happiness and joy.</p>

<p>You don’t have to wait ten years to experience this happiness. It is present in every moment of your daily life.</p>
<p>Most people are forgetful; they are not really there a lot of the time. Their mind is caught in their worries, their fears, their anger, and their regrets, and they are not mindful of being there. That state of being is called forgetfulness—you are there but you are not there. You are caught in the past or in the future. You are not there in the present moment, living your life deeply. That is forgetfulness.</p>

<p>The opposite of forgetfulness is mindfulness. Mindfulness is when you are truly there, mind and body together. You breathe in and out mindfully, you bring your mind back to your body, and you are there. When your mind is there with your body, you are established in the present moment. Then you can recognize the many conditions of happiness that are in you and around you, and happiness just comes naturally.</p>

<p>Mindfulness practice should be enjoyable, not work or effort. Do you have to make an effort to breathe in? You don’t need to make an effort. To breathe in, you just breathe in. Suppose you are with a group of people contemplating a beautiful sunset. Do you have to make an effort to enjoy the beautiful sunset? No, you don’t have to make any effort. You just enjoy it.</p>

<p>The same thing is true with your breath. Allow your breath to take place. Become aware of it and enjoy it. Effortlessness. Enjoyment. The same thing is true with walking mindfully. Every step you take is enjoyable. Every step helps you to touch the wonders of life, in yourself and around you. Every step is peace. Every step is joy. That is possible.</p>

<p>During the time you are practicing mindfulness, you stop talking—not only the talking outside, but the talking inside. The talking inside is the thinking, the mental discourse that goes on and on and on inside. Real silence is the cessation of talking—of both the mouth and of the mind. This is not the kind of silence that oppresses us. It is a very elegant kind of silence, a very powerful kind of silence. It is the silence that heals and nourishes us.</p>

<p>Mindfulness gives birth to joy and happiness. Another source of happiness is concentration. The energy of mindfulness carries within it the energy of concentration. When you are aware of something, such as a flower, and can maintain that awareness, we say that you are concentrated on the flower. When your mindfulness becomes powerful, your concentration becomes powerful, and when you are fully concentrated, you have a chance to make a breakthrough, to achieve insight. If you meditate on a cloud, you can get insight into the nature of the cloud. Or you can meditate on a pebble, and if you have enough mindfulness and concentration, you can see into the nature of the pebble. You can meditate on a person, and if you have enough mindfulness and concentration, you can make a breakthrough and understand the nature of that person. You can meditate on yourself, or your anger, or your fear, or your joy, or your peace.</p>

<p>Anything can be the object of your meditation, and with the powerful energy of concentration, you can make a breakthrough and develop insight. It’s like a magnifying glass concentrating the light of the sun. If you put the point of concentrated light on a piece of paper, it will burn. Similarly, when your mindfulness and concentration are powerful, your insight will liberate you from fear, anger, and despair, and bring you true joy, true peace, and true happiness.</p>

<p>When your mindfulness becomes powerful, your concentration becomes powerful, and when you are fully concentrated, you have a chance to make a breakthrough, to achieve insight.</p>
<p>When you contemplate the big, full sunrise, the more mindful and concentrated you are, the more the beauty of the sunrise is revealed to you. Suppose you are offered a cup of tea, very fragrant, very good tea. If your mind is distracted, you cannot really enjoy the tea. You have to be mindful of the tea, you have to be concentrated on it, so the tea can reveal its fragrance and wonder to you. That is why mindfulness and concentration are such sources of happiness. That’s why a good practitioner knows how to create a moment of joy, a feeling of happiness, at any time of the day.</p>

<p>First Mindfulness Exercise ~ Mindful Breathing
The first exercise is very simple, but the power, the result, can be very great. The exercise is simply to identify the in-breath as in-breath and the out-breath as the out-breath. When you breathe in, you know that this is your in-breath. When you breathe out, you are mindful that this is your out-breath.</p>

<p>Just recognize ~ this is an in-breath, this is an out-breath. Very simple, very easy. In order to recognize your in-breath as in-breath, you have to bring your mind home to yourself. What is recognizing your in-breath is your mind, and the object of your mind—the object of your mindfulness—is the in-breath. Mindfulness is always mindful of something. When you drink your tea mindfully, it’s called mindfulness of drinking. When you walk mindfully, it’s called mindfulness of walking. And when you breathe mindfully, that is mindfulness of breathing.</p>

<p>So the object of your mindfulness is your breath, and you just focus your attention on it. Breathing in, this is my in-breath. Breathing out, this is my out-breath. When you do that, the mental discourse will stop. You don’t think anymore. You don’t have to make an effort to stop your thinking; you bring your attention to your in-breath and the mental discourse just stops. That is the miracle of the practice. You don’t think of the past anymore. You don’t think of the future. You don’t think of your projects, because you are focusing your attention, your mindfulness, on your breath.</p>

      <p>The in-breath can be a celebration of the fact that you are alive, so it can be very joyful.</p>
<p>It gets even better. You can enjoy your in-breath. The practice can be pleasant, joyful. Someone who is dead cannot take any more in-breaths. But you are alive. You are breathing in, and while breathing in, you know that you are alive. The in-breath can be a celebration of the fact that you are alive, so it can be very joyful. When you are joyful and happy, you don’t feel that you have to make any effort at all. I am alive; I am breathing in. To be still alive is a miracle. The greatest of all miracles is to be alive, and when you breathe in, you touch that miracle. Therefore, your breathing can be a celebration of life.</p>

<p>An in-breath may take three, four, five seconds, it depends. That’s time to be alive, time to enjoy your breath. You don’t have to interfere with your breathing. If your in-breath is short, allow it to be short. If your out-breath is long, let it to be long. Don’t try to force it. The practice is simple recognition of the in-breath and the out-breath. That is good enough. It will have a powerful effect.</p>

<p>Second Mindfulness Exercise ~ Concentration
The second exercise is that while you breathe in, you follow your in-breath from the beginning to the end. If your in-breath lasts three or four seconds, then your mindfulness also lasts three or four seconds. Breathing in, I follow my in-breath all the way through. Breathing out, I follow my out-breath all the way through. From the beginning of my out-breath to the end of my out-breath, my mind is always with it. Therefore, mindfulness becomes uninterrupted, and the quality of your concentration is improved.</p>

<p>So the second exercise is to follow your in-breath and your out-breath all the way through. Whether they are short or long, it doesn’t matter. What is important is that you follow your in-breath from the beginning to the end. Your awareness is sustained. There is no interruption. Suppose you are breathing in, and then you think, “Oh, I forgot to turn off the light in my room.” There is an interruption. Just stick to your in-breath all the way through. Then you cultivate your mindfulness and your concentration. You become your in-breath. You become your out-breath. If you continue like that, your breathing will naturally become deeper and slower, more harmonious and peaceful. You don’t have to make any effort—it happens naturally.</p>

<p>Third Mindfulness Exercise ~ Awareness of Your Body
The third exercise is to become aware of your body as you are breathing. “Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body.” This takes it one step further.</p>

<p>In the first exercise, you became aware of your in-breath and your out-breath. Because you have now generated the energy of mindfulness through mindful breathing, you can use that energy to recognize your body.</p>

<p>“Breathing in, I am aware of my body. Breathing out, I am aware of my body.” I know my body is there. This brings the mind wholly back to the body. Mind and body become one reality. When your mind is with your body, you are well-established in the here and the now. You are fully alive. You can be in touch with the wonders of life that are available in yourself and around you.</p>

<p>This exercise is simple, but the effect of the oneness of body and mind is very great. In our daily lives, we are seldom in that situation. Our body is there but our mind is elsewhere. Our mind may be caught in the past or in the future, in regrets, sorrow, fear, or uncertainty, and so our mind is not there. Someone may be present in the house, but he’s not really there, his mind is not there. His mind is with the future, with his projects, and he’s not there for his children or his spouse. Maybe you could say to him, “Anybody home?” and help him bring his mind back to his body.</p>

<p>So the third exercise is to become aware of your body. “Breathing in, I’m aware of my body.” When you practice mindful breathing, the quality of your in-breath and out-breath will be improved. There is more peace and harmony in your breathing, and if you continue to practice like that, the peace and the harmony will penetrate into the body, and the body will profit.</p>

<p>Fourth Mindfulness Exercise ~ Releasing Tension
The next exercise is to release the tension in the body. When you are truly aware of your body, you notice there is some tension and pain in your body, some stress. The tension and pain have been accumulating for a long time and our bodies suffer, but our mind is not there to help release it. Therefore, it is very important to learn how to release the tension in the body.</p>

      <p>It is always possible to practice releasing the tension in yourself.</p>
<p>In a sitting, lying, or standing position, it’s always possible to release the tension. You can practice total relaxation, deep relaxation, in a sitting or lying position. While you are driving your car, you might notice the tension in your body. You are eager to arrive and you don’t enjoy the time you spend driving. When you come to a red light, you are eager for the red light to become a green light so that you can continue. But the red light can be a signal. It can be a reminder that there is tension in you, the stress of wanting to arrive as quickly as possible. If you recognize that, you can make use of the red light. You can sit back and relax—take the ten seconds the light is red to practice mindful breathing and release the tension in the body.</p>

<p>So next time you’re stopped at a red light, you might like to sit back and practice the fourth exercise: “Breathing in, I’m aware of my body. Breathing out, I release the tension in my body.” Peace is possible at that moment, and it can be practiced many times a day—in the workplace, while you are driving, while you are cooking, while you are doing the dishes, while you are watering the vegetable garden. It is always possible to practice releasing the tension in yourself.</p>

<p>Walking Meditation `
When you practice mindful breathing you simply allow your in breath to take place. You become aware of it and enjoy it. Effortlessness. The same thing is true with mindful walking. Every step is enjoyable. Every step helps you touch the wonders of life. Every step is joy. That is possible.</p>

<p>You don’t have to make any effort during walking meditation, because it is enjoyable. You are there, body and mind together. You are fully alive, fully present in the here and the now. With every step, you touch the wonders of life that are in you and around you. When you walk like that, every step brings healing. Every step brings peace and joy, because every step is a miracle.</p>

<p>The real miracle is not to fly or walk on fire. The real miracle is to walk on the Earth, and you can perform that miracle at any time. Just bring your mind home to your body, become alive, and perform the miracle of walking on Earth.p

    <header>Noting Technique</header>
    <article>
      <p>Thinking can be a powerful force of distraction, preventing us from being mindfully present in a useful way. During meditation, a simple method in which we use thinking to stay present rather than carrying us away is ‘mental noting’. This is the practice of using a simple “note” to calmly name – as a whisper in the mind – what we are experiencing. Though it can take a while to learn, and can be awkward at first, with practice, mental noting can become second nature.</p>

<p>Noting directs thinking into a simple, rudimentary form, rather than letting it wander off into distraction. “An idle mind will get in trouble” is a saying that describes how an insufficiently attentive mind can all too easily drift off into thought. Mental noting gives the thinking mind something to do which supports meditation rather than distracts from it. It can be a useful way to interrupt the incessant flow of discursive thoughts.</p>

<p>In contrast to most thinking, noting is not discursive. It does not involve analysis or judgment. Rather, we simply give our current experience a one-word label. For example, upon hearing a sound we note ‘hearing’ without thinking further about the sound. Other common mental notes are ‘seeing’, ‘touching’, ‘feeling’, and ‘thinking’.</p>

<p>Some experiences may be given more descriptive labels. For example, sensations may be noted as ‘warmth’, ‘coolness’, ‘pressure’, ‘tightness’, and so on. Emotions may be named: ‘happiness’, ‘sadness’, ‘excitement’, ‘fear’. Mental activity may be recognized as ‘wanting’, ‘planning’, ‘resisting’, and the like. With mindfulness of breathing a common note is ‘rising’ as the belly or chest lifts on the inhalation, and ‘falling’ as we exhale.</p>

<p>Usually, a specific note is repeated until the experience being noted disappears, is sufficiently acknowledged, or is no longer predominant.</p>

<p>Noting in meditation has many functions. The primary one is keeping the meditator present – sometimes it is called an ‘anchor’ to the present. The mind is less likely to wander off if one keeps up a steady stream of relaxed noting. If the mind does wander, the noting practice can make it easier to reestablish mindfulness.</p>

<p>Another function of noting is to better acknowledge or recognize what is occurring: the clearer one’s recognition, the more effective one’s mindfulness. Naming can strengthen recognition. Sometimes this can be a kind of truth-telling, when we are reluctant to admit something about ourselves or about what is happening.</p>

<p>A third function of noting is to help recognize patterns in one’s experience. A frequently-repeated note reveals a frequently-recurring experience. For example, persistent worriers may not realize it until they see how often they note ‘worry’.</p>

<p>And fourth, as described above, mental noting gives the thinking mind something to do rather than leaving it to its own devices.</p>

<p>A fifth function is disentangling us from being preoccupied or overly identified with experience. Noting can help us ‘step away’ so that we might see more clearly. For example, noting ‘wanting’ might pull us out of the preoccupation with something we want. This may not be immediate, but by repeatedly noting ‘wanting, wanting,’ one may be able to be aware of the wanting without being caught by it. As an antidote to drowning in strong emotion or obsessive thinking, mental noting is sometimes called a ‘life preserver’.</p>

<p>Noting can also help maintain a non-reactive form of attention. Calmly and equanimously noting what is happening, we are less likely to get caught up in emotional reactions. The stories of Mara, the god of temptation and distraction, visiting the Buddha illustrate this. The Buddha does not chase Mara away, nor does he give in. He simply looks at him directly and says, “Mara, I see you.” With this, Mara runs away. Similarly, noting ‘fear’ can be like saying, “Fear, I see you.” Noting helps us to see mindfully while remaining free of what we see.</p>

<p>The tone of the inner voice that notes may reveal less-than-equanimous reactions to what we are trying to be mindful of. The noting may sound harsh, bored, scared, hesitant, or excited, to name just a few possibilities. By noticing and adjusting the tone, we may become more balanced and equanimous.</p>

<p>Each person needs to find his or her own way of noting – it isn’t a fixed technique. And as circumstances change, how one notes may change. Sometimes, what is most useful is calmly noting everything one is being mindful of. Other times, noting may be useful when one is easily distracted but not when one is settled. Some people only use noting when being mindful of particular experiences, such as thinking or feeling emotions. Others limit their noting to naming only what is distracting. And some people find that it is never helpful to use mental noting; they prefer a more silent form of knowing.</p>

<p>The noting practice has a number of pitfalls. It can become rote or mechanical. When one notices this, it’s often useful to pause and relax before starting again. Another hazard is focusing too much on noting at the expense of being mindful. One version of this is the ‘check-list approach’ to mindfulness – one believes it is enough to simply note an experience. Noting is mostly a slight nudge to encourage mindfulness, so that attentiveness to the felt experience increases. Another pitfall is that noting may become an attempt to control or drive one’s experience instead of simply recognizing it. Or it may be used to create an artificial distance from experience: naming becomes a substitute for feeling. Relaxing and allowing the mindfulness to become more receptive can help with this.</p>

<p>Noting can become a hindrance to meditation if one starts thinking about what word to use. Sometimes beginners to mental noting are too concerned with the ‘right’ note. The most obvious label is good enough. If a vague note like “here” or “this” helps one stay present, it has fulfilled its primary function. While precision in noting can sometimes sharpen mindfulness and help with insight, there is no need to analyze one’s way to greater precision.</p>

<p>Some people find that as the mind becomes more peaceful in meditation they may need to adjust the relative ‘loudness’ or ‘intensity’ of the noting to keep it in harmony with the meditative stillness. As the mind becomes quieter, so should the mental noting. It can become a softer and softer whisper. At times words are no longer needed – a soft “hmm” may suffice.</p>

<p>A basic principle for the practice of mental noting is to use it when it is helpful and to avoid it when it is not. Mindfulness practice aims to cultivate awareness, insight and liberation. It can be quite satisfying when noting supports these aims. It can be a reminder that all of one’s faculties can be used in the service of freedom, including our cognitive functions such as naming our experience.</p>

    <header>Labeling Technique</header>
    <article>
    <p>While simply observing your thoughts and letting them go is an effective meditation technique, and can be practiced for long periods of time, it can be helpful to take things a step further and “label” your thoughts before you let them go. (You can do this by saying the word to yourself, visualizing it written, or whatever feels comfortable to you.)</p>

<p>Labeling your thoughts does two things: it raises your awareness of the kinds of things you think about, which is especially helpful if you are trying to change your habitual thought patterns to become more empowering and optimistic. It also allows your mind to engage somewhat, which can be helpful for beginners who are not used to simply observing their thoughts for long periods of time. It gives your mind something to do while still maintaining detachment. There are several different ways that you can label your thoughts:</p>

<p>Useful / Not Useful: You can simply label whether a thought is constructive or not. This is a very simple distinction that can cover virtually all thoughts. Just label them “useful” or “not useful,” and let them go.
Types of Thoughts: You can label your thoughts with greater depth by classifying them according to their function. Thoughts that can be labeled as “judgment,” “planning,” “fear,” and “remembering,” for example, may drift into your awareness. Label them, and let them go.
Physical Sensations: Another type of awareness that may drift in is body awareness—you may notice and focus on what you see or feel. Simply label things what they are as sensations: “hard,” “warm,” “itchy.” Acknowledge them and let them go.</p>
<p>There are other ways in which you can label your thoughts, but this provides you with a starting place. As you practice, you may find methods that work better, one of the above techniques may become a favorite, or you can rotate. Whatever works for you is the “right” way. Just remember that regular meditation builds resilience toward stress, so it's worth trying, and sticking with until you find a style that works for you. Get started, and see what benefits this practice brings.</p>

     <p>The first Milestone is continuous attention to the meditation object, which you achieve at the end of Stage Three. Before this, you’re a beginner—a person who meditates, rather than a skilled meditator. When you reach this Milestone, you’re no longer a novice, prone to forgetting, mind-wandering, or dozing off. By mastering Stages One through Three, you have acquired the basic, first level skills on the way to stable attention. You can now do something that no ordinary, untrained person can. You will build on this initial skillset over the course of the next three Stages of meditation to become a truly skilled meditator.</p>
